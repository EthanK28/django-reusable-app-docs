What is a reusable app?
=======================

A reusable Django app, is an app that is easily plugged into a
project, providing a very specific piece of functionality. They should
be focused and follow the Unix philosophy of "Do one thing and do it
well." Please refer to James Bennett's `Djangocon talk
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-S0tqpPga4>`__ on the subject for
more info.


How do I distribute my app?
===========================

Django should be using the standard `Python Package Index
<http://pypi.python.org/pypi>`__ aka Pypi or the Cheese Shop. I wrote
a `tutorial <http://ericholscher.com/blog/2008/aug/6/easily-packing-
and-distributing-django-apps-setupt/>`__ about how to easily package
and upload your app to Pypi. All reusable apps should be uploading to
Pypi.

If you upload your app to Pypi, it is generally a good idea to prefix
your project name with "django-"

Also note, that when below when we refer to the default place for
something as a file, that also means that you can make a directory of
that same name; as per normal python.
