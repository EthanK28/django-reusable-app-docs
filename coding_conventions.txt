Coding conventions
==================

+ All code should follow `PEP8
  <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`__ as closely as
  reasonable.
+ All code should preferably follow Django's `coding conventions
  <http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/contributing/#coding-
  style>`__ as well.
