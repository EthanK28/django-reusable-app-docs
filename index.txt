What is a reusable app?
=======================

A reusable Django app, is an app that is easily plugged into a
project, providing a very specific piece of functionality. They should
be focused and follow the Unix philosophy of "Do one thing and do it
well." Please refer to James Bennett's `Djangocon talk
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-S0tqpPga4>`__ on the subject for
more info.
